        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A perfect way to enjoy a warm meal for the winter season that fits the carnivore lifestyle. There are only three ingredients in this recipe, but feel free to adapt it to your lifestyle. </p>
        <p>Bone broth is an incredibly easy process with huge benefits of the nutrients and collagen from the bones. The key to unlocking the flavor with little ingredients is to cook this low and slow.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4-5lbs of soup bones (any kind)</li>
            <li>Filtered water</li>
            <li>Redmond salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay your bones on a baking sheet with parchment paper and roast them in the oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes (30-35 if from frozen)</li>
            <li>Transfer the roasted bones to your dutch oven, stock pot, crock pot, or instant pot</li>
            <li>Add redmond salt to taste</li>
            <li>(optional) Add chicken or duck feet for added collagen</If>
            <li>Cover the bones with filtered water. I typically just add enough to barely cover them, but its difficult to go wrong here.</If>
            <li>For a dutch oven or stock pot: Simmer on your smallest burner on low for 8-12 hours (or longer if you prefer, it can simmer up to 48 hours)</If>
            <li>For a crockpot: Set on low for 8-12 hours (or longer if you prefer, it can simmer up to 48 hours)</If>
            <li>For a pressure cooker / instant pot: Set on manual for 3-4 hours</If>
            <li>Let the broth cool off a bit, then remove the bones and strain off the liquid and pour into glass mason jars for storage. I prefer to use a stainless steel fine mesh strainer to do this.</If>
            <li>Keep the broth in the fridge for up to a week, or the freezer for 6-12 months. Be very careful not to overfill the glass jars if you are freezing, as the liquid expands and the glass can break. Reheat on the stovetop to drink or use for cooking.</If>
            <li>If the broth has lots of fat in it, it will harden at the top of the jar in a golden layer when refrigerated. It's up to you whether or not you want to drink that. If there's a lot, I remove it and save it to cook with as I don't want those nutrients to go to waste.</If>
        </ol>
